Here, we delve into how biological structures and processes have directly inspired specific machine learning algorithms.

### Neural Networks

The human brain, a biological marvel, is the ultimate inspiration for **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**.

* **Neurons:** Basic processing units.
* **Synapses:** Connections between neurons, where learning occurs by adjusting connection strengths.

### Genetic Algorithms

Evolutionary processes, particularly natural selection, form the basis of **Genetic Algorithms**. These algorithms mimic biological evolution to solve optimization problems.
