## Preface

Technology is advancing faster than ever, and AI is at the forefront of this revolution. When I began my journey, I found complex jargon and intimidating mathematical formulas everywhere. My goal in writing "**The AI Jungle : Learn AI & ML with Nature's Wisdom**" is to break down these barriers by turning intricate theories into relatable scenarios. I hope this book inspires you to embrace new technologies with confidence and curiosity.

I bring over 15 years of experience in designing and developing scalable, cloud-native solutions across major platforms like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. Throughout my career, I’ve tackled challenges in microservices architecture using Java, Spring Boot, and Kubernetes, as well as front-end work with React and TypeScript. My passion for AI/ML led me to explore frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jupyter, and Hugging Face Transformers—tools that enable machines to learn from data just as we humans do from experience.

Thank you for choosing this guide to accompany you on your AI adventure. Let’s dive in and unravel the remarkable world of Artificial Intelligence together.
