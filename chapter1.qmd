In this chapter, we lay the groundwork by examining fundamental intelligent behaviors observed in nature.

### Swarm Intelligence

Think about a flock of birds, a school of fish, or an ant colony. Individually, these creatures may seem simple, but collectively, they exhibit complex, intelligent behavior. This is known as **Swarm Intelligence**.

* **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):** Inspired by ants finding the shortest path to food.
* **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** Modeled after the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling.
